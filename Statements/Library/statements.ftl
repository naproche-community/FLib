# Statements

Let a statement stand for a set. Let a predicate stand for a statement.

Let P(x) stand for x is an element of P. Let P holds for x stand for P(x). Let P
hold for x stand for P(x).


# Propositions

Let FALSE stand for contradiction.
Let TRUE  stand for not FALSE.

Definition. A proposition is a predicate P such that P holds for all objects or
P holds for no object. Let P,Q denote propositions.

Definition. \top = {x | TRUE}.
Definition. \bot = {x | FALSE}.

Lemma. \top and \bot are propositions.

Let P is true stand for every object is an element of P.
Let P is false stand for P is not true.


Lemma. If P and Q are true then P = Q.

Lemma. P is true or P is false.

Lemma. P is true iff P is not false.


# Arities of statements

Let P denote a predicate.


Signature. P has one free variable is an atom.

Definition. P has at most one free variable iff P is a proposition or P has one
free variable.

Signature. P has two free variables is an atom. Let P(x,y) stand for P((x,y)).


Axiom. Let x,y,a,b be objects. If (a,b) = (x,y) then a = x and b = y.
