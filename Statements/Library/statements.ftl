P holds for no object. Let P,Q denote propositions.

Definition. \top = {x | TRUE}.
Definition. \bot = {x | FALSE}.

Lemma. \top and \bot are propositions.

Let P is true stand for every object is an element of P.
Let P is false stand for P is not true.


Lemma. If P and Q are true then P = Q.

Lemma. P is true or P is false.

Lemma. P is true iff P is not false.
