This is an adaption of the formalization of Peano Arithmetic in this library to
an extension of Naproche-SAD which supports the use of LaTeX environments within
ForTheL. This extension is currently under development and has not been
officially released yet. Its source code can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/PraktikumWS20-21/Naproche-SAD/tree/latex-mode).
